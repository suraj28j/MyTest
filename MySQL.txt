(1) Creat Database
creat database database_name


(2) Select or Use database
use database_name;


(3) Creat Table
creat table table_name(
column1 DataType,
column2 DataType,
column3 DataType,
  ...
  ...
);


(4) Insert Data in Table
insert into table_name(column1, column2, column2, ...)
values(value1, value2, value3, ...);


(5) Insert Multiple Row
insert into table_name(column1, column2, column2, ...)
values
(value1, value2, value3, ...),
(value1, value2, value3, ...),
(value1, value2, value3, ...);


(6) Constraints
(a) NOT NULL
(b) CHECK()
(c) UNIQUE
(d) DEFAULT 'value'

   Example :-  creat table table_name(
				id int NOT NULL UNIQUE,
				name varchar (30) NOT NULL,
				age int NOT NULL CHECK(age>=18),
				gender varchar(10) NOT NULL,
				mobile varchar(15) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
				city varchar(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Banglore'
				);
				


(7) Show table
(a) select * FROM table_name; // all column
(b) select id, name, phone from table_name // seleceted column
(c) select id as ID, name as "Studnet Name", phone as Phone from table_name // change column name (on show time) 
(d) select with WHERE Clause      
    select * from table_name
	
    Example 1:-  where gender = "F";
	Example 2:-  where city = "Banglore" AND age>=20
	Example 3:-  where (city = "Banglore" OR city = "Lucknow") AND age>=20
	Example 4:-  where NOT (city = "Banglore" OR city = "Lucknow") AND age>=20
	
	Example 5:-  IN / NOT IN
				 (i) where age IN(19,21) // age 19 and 21 only
				 (ii) where  city NOT IN("Delhi","Mumbai")
				 
	Example 6:-  BETWEEN / NOT BETWEEN
				 (i) where  age BETWEEN 18 and 19
				 (ii) where  age NOT BETWEEN 18 and 
				 (iii) where  name BETWEEN "a" and "r"
				 
	Example 7:-  LIKE
				 (i) where  name LIKE "s%"
			     (ii) where  name NOT LIKE "s%"
				 LIKE  'a%'     -   Start with "a"
				 LIKE  '%a'     -   End with "a"
				 LIKE  '%am%'   -   have "am" any position
				 LIKE  'a%m'    -   Start with "a" and end with "m"
				 LIKE  '_a%'    -   "a" in the second position
				 LIKE  '__a%'   -   "a" in the third position
				 LIKE  '_oy'    -   "o" in the second position and "y" in the third position
				 
	Example 8:-  Regular Expression
				 (i) where name REGEXP 'ra' 
				 (ii) where name REGEXP "kumar|dubey|jain"
				  
				  ^				'^ra'					Beginning of string
				  $				'an$'					End of string
				  [...]			'[rms]'					Any character listed between the square brackets
				  ^[...]		'^[rms]'				Begins with Any character listed between the square brackets
				  [a-z]			'[a-h]e'				Match with in the range
				  p1|p2|p3		'tom|dick|harry'		match any of the patterns p1, p2 or p3
				  
	Example 9:-  Select Data with   IS NULL |  IS NOT NULL
				(i) where name IS NULL
				(ii) where age IS NOT NULL
				
	Example 10:-  Select Data with LIMIT
				(i) where age<=20 LIMIT 3
				(ii) where  name LIKE "%a"  LIMIT 4
				(iii) where gender = "F"   order by name   limit 3
				(iv) where gender = "F"  LIMIT 3, 5; // first digit is offset number
				  
(e) Select Data with ORDER by ASC | DESC
	Example 1:-  ORDER by name ASC
	Example 2:-  ORDER by name DESC
	Example 3:-  where gender = 'F' // condition
				 ORDER by age	// by default ascending order
	Example 4:-  ORDER by name, city;

(f) Select Data from DISTINCT
	Example 1:- select DISTINCT city from table_name
